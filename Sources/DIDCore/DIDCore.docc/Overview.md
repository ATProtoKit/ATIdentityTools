# ``DIDCore``

Identify and validate Decentralized Identifiers in the AT Protocol.

## Overview

``DIDCore`` is a foundational Swift package for working with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as specified by [W3C DID Core](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and used in the AT Protocol ecosystem. This library enables developers to construct, validate, parse, and work with DIDs and DID Documentsâ€”ensuring strict compliance with both the W3C standards and AT Protocol-specific requirements.

A Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a unique string, such as `did:plc:abcd1234efgh5678ijkl9012mnop3456`, that identifies an entity in a decentralized system. DIDs are used for identity, authentication, and data integrity across decentralized networks.

There are two DID methods that are considered "blessed" in the AT Protocol: `did:plc` (which is created specifically for the AT Protocol) and `did:web` (which was created by the W3C).

### What DIDCore provides

- Enforces strict validation rules for `did:plc` and `did:web` identifiers, complying to AT Protocol requirements.
- Includes robust, type-safe representations of DIDs and DID Documents.
- Ensures DID Documents are compliant with both the W3C and AT Protocol.
